h2. Dr. Funk

This is a tool for writing and managing functional/acceptance tests. It can also be used to mark progress while manually testing an application.

A live demo is available at "http://funk.heroku.com":http://funk.heroku.com.

This is not a tool for automating tests? So why would I use it?

* You want to write acceptance tests quickly in order think through scenarios that are to be estimated. So you write the test, estimate, build, and automate with a different tool entirely.
* Automation isn't always worth the cost and your manual tests need a home.

If these things don't appeal to you and you are familiar with cucumber, you might be looking for "lowdown?":http://mcp.r09.railsrumble.com/

h2. Purpose

Working with acceptance tests can be a fairly draining process, but the value they carry is significant.

Dr. Funk eases the burden by:
* Making test steps simple to manage and edit
* Keeping organization flexible
* Leaving formatting up to the editor
* Tracking manual testing progress

h2. Not so obvious features

*HTML output* - Click the HTML link for any plan for customer sharable HTML output. 

*Step tracking* - Once inside a scenario, press the up/down arrow keys to highlight the step you are currently testing. Press Esc to stop tracking.

*Test failures* - Marking failures is done by editing a step and using the following syntax:

<pre>
The popup is displayed

failure. with the text "Funky!"
</pre>

Failures have to start on a new line as shown above. Multiple failures for a single step is fine. Once marked, they will show up on the list of Test Failures for a plan.

h2. Installation

Dr. Funk requires Rails 3

<pre>
cp config/database.sample.yml config/database.yml
gem install bundler
bundle install --without production
rake db:setup
</pre>
